<h1>Welcome to our app</h1>
<p id = "description-text">Online tutorial and mentorship programs offer flexibility and convenience, but they also come with several challenges. One major issue is the lack of face-to-face interaction, which can make it harder to build strong relationships between mentors and learners. Many programs use standard content that may not suit individual learning styles or paces, leading to frustration or confusion.
    <br><br>
    Poor communication and limited interaction between mentors and learners can also hinder progress, especially in the absence of real-time feedback or face-to-face engagement. Scheduling difficulties, due to time zone differences and varying availability, often lead to missed sessions and inconsistent mentorship.
    <br><br>
In addition, some platforms suffer from low quality control, where mentors may lack proper qualifications or training. Technical problems like poor internet connectivity, platform glitches, or a lack of digital literacy can further disrupt the learning experience.
Lastly, learners often struggle with low motivation and accountability, especially when feedback is delayed or support is minimal. These challenges can significantly impact learning outcomes and the overall success of the mentorship or tutorial experience.

<br><br>
Limited Interaction and Community:
Problem: Online courses often feel isolating, with limited opportunities for direct interaction with instructors or fellow students.
Our Solution: We create a community-driven learning environment where students can interact with their mentors and peers. Beyond just tutorials, we offer opportunities for collaborative learning, group discussions, and peer support, ensuring that you're never alone in your learning journey.
